      <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 25px;">
        With the constant increase of machines, our time cherishes restless individuals that never (admit to) stop. It steals away the poets, listeners, observers and dreamers as they usually leave no evidence of production. At the expanse of all others, we might have developed sixth sense: for competition, but this maturing of our hyperactive ego is causing us to loose connection to deep inner compassionate focus on the truly important things to live for (which differ in each of us).
        <br>As mentioned before, in this part of the world, we are blessed to live in freedom, yet my gut tells me that a society running on emphasis on efficiency and rapid performance is not a completely free society.  If we think about it, hyperactivity doesn’t really lead to unique new and beautiful revelations, it just makes us milling the same thing over and over.
        <br><br>
        We are thus now for some time at the mercy of rolling and flooding events and to manage all the absurdity we started turning towards different forms of harming dopping , because we are not made to live up to this speed and multitasking, neither is the planet. Advances in performance regardless of the needs of the soul leads to burnout. Again, same goes for the ecosystem if we disrespect its natural cycles. That is what I was trying to prove: looking back at our own nature can teach us a lot about the mechanisms and needs of the outside, because everything is connected and relates to each other.<br><br>
        Connectivity is a term that lead us through this research, both in a positive as well as negative context. On one hand, it showed that it is a part of our human nature to function in relations, because even the whole cosmic existence can be based on this principle in the first place. On the other hand, with the technology merging in, this predisposition of ours to share became actually contraproductive, thus distracting us from our basic fullfiling needs.<br><br><br></p>
        <p style:"font-size: 10px">Art teaches us to observe and find these patterns and implications in the obscure. Design teaches us to question and find answers and solutions. The creativity in an individual challenges to bring new better ways and to not only visually, but also semantically ameliorate our world.<br>
        <br><br>
        As implied in this thesis, this moment in our history does ask exactly for such energy and urge, which I believe, can be found mostly in our generation. Millennial designers are thoughtful and brought up to innovate from the base of what they criticise. <br><i>But could we perhaps apply the positive psychology here?<br>How can we love in Graphic Design?<br>How can we trigger experience from Graphic Design? And how can we bring people together to cooperate?</i> 
        <br><br>Graphic designers in specific, have an incredible ability to see the relations between very different aspects of a problem and communicate it, which can help us in any sector.<br><br>
        This is still a beginning of a significant change with technology and it can mean amount of good (and sustainable) improvements, however only if we think it out well before it takes away all that is prosperous to our essence (as it seemed to be galvanizing by far).<br><br>Now we know what it really means to be <i>human</i> and we have to embrace the empowering congenital motive to cooperate, even if it doesn’t secure implicit and instant rewards. It needs to start within an individual and demonstrate its effect in the whole nation. Our virtual world made us aware of the diversity within people and freed us from prejudices our ancestors live by, because they never had the possibilities to see as much as we do. We only need to grasp and use the good potentials in our devices. Avoid being manipulated by them and don’t allow it to take us away from truly seeing. The world of our generation is not a local world anymore. Our reality is ranging far beyond and our options to use our creativity up to the moon.

        Don’t give up on your own capabilities. Give up on the things that distract you from your own capabilities. Don’t spend time on being angry about politics, don’t most of all depend on those people up there to change something. It really needs to start in our own circle of interests. I wonder; Why don’t we allow ourselves to feel again? Why don’t we make this world more personal to us? Let’s come back to our state of questioning like a little curious child who wants to see the world bright. Indeed, it will only get us to realize that the current world is set on wrong values, but the more of us gradually discharge this rationalized and profit driven idea about life (even just in our mindsets), the more chance there is that we will suddenly happen to stand one next to another, supporting the same thing: to not harm each other anymore! 
        <br>Thank you...for staying human.
